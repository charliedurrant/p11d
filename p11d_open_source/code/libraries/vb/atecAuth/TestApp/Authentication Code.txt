0. A function exists which returns a recordset containing the values of specified Active Directory fields for a specified user. If user cannot be authenticated, recordset is nothing


1. Call the function with the username and password of the built-in user, returning the path within the Active Directory of the target user.


2. If recordset returned, call the function again with the username and password of the target user. If recordset returned, user is authenticated.

The main changes we are making to the 2006-07 P11D are as follows.
Employee Details
We are introducing 2 new boxes for employee Date of Birth, and Gender (Sex M/F)
to be completed when the NINO is not available. We anticipate that the validation for
these fields will be the same as the Date of Birth and Gender fields on the P14.
These new fields are being introduced to help HMRC locate an employee when the
NINO isn’t present.
Company Cars
 Fuel types B and H, the standard reduction is increased by 1% each (to 2% and
3% respectively), but the extra adjustment for very low CO2 emission cars no
longer applies.
 Fuel type C, the reduction no longer applies.
 Fuel type L, the supplement for type D cars also applies to type L cars first
registered on or after 1 January 2006.
A draft version of the 2006-07 P11D will be available in the next edition of these
Notes expected to be published early summer 2006.

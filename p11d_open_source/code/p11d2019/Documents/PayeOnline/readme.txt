P46
-------------------------
Me 

Quick question, I’ve noticed there is no new schema for 17/18 for EXB. When I submit a test P46 car submission for the first quarter 2017/18 all is okay, 
I just wanted to confirm that using the 16/17 schema for 2017/18 P46 submissions is correct?

Charles,
 
The current Schema and Business Validation Rules, published in the technical pack at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/paye-internet-submissions-expenses-and-benefits-schema , 
are for use with the 2016-17 P11D/P11D(b) and 2017-18 P46(Car) returns.
 
It’s always been this way for Expenses & Benefits. We have one over-arching schema which covers all the relevant message types but the P46(Car) is 
always one year ahead of the P11D. This is due to what is, essentially, an in-year form being tied to an end of year form. So, the 16-17 P11D is 
actually submitted in the 17-18 tax year…therefore, it follows that the associated P46(Car) is also for the 17-18 tax.
 
Slightly confusing but again, it’s been like this since the inception of the online Expenses & Benefits service.
 
Regards
